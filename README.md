#  Ingestor ETL ‚Äì Open Source Version

**Ingestor ETL** is an open source Python-based tool developed by **PAiCore Technologies**. It enables the parsing and ingestion of network trace files (*PCAP/PCAPNG*) for various telecom protocols into a **PostgreSQL** database.

This repository is designed for educational and community-driven collaboration, demonstrating how to handle the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for telecom network data.

---

##  What‚Äôs Included

- üêç **Python scripts** for parsing Diameter, GTP, SIP, SMPP, HTTP, GSM MAP, and other protocols.
- üóÑÔ∏è Example **PostgreSQL configuration** to store parsed data.
- üìÑ Example `config.py` and `requirements.txt`.

---

##  Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** (local or remote)
- Recommended OS: **Ubuntu 22.04** or similar

Before running, ensure your PostgreSQL server allows remote connections and has appropriate user permissions.

---

##  Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Main packages used:**

- dpkt
- pycrate
- smpppdu
- SQLAlchemy
- psycopg2
- xmltodict

---

##  Database Setup

**Step 1:** Create two databases:
- `nbm` ‚Üí Raw trace storage.
- `ingestion` ‚Üí Parsed and processed data.

**Step 2:** Create a PostgreSQL user with appropriate privileges.

**Example connection (`config.py`):**

```python
class Settings():
    DB_HOSTNAME: str = "127.0.0.1"
    DB_PORT: str = "5432"
    DB_NAME: str = "nbm"
    DB_USERNAME: str = "your_username"
    DB_PASSWORD: str = "your_password"

settings = Settings()
```

##  How to Run

Run the desired ingestor for your protocol:

```bash
python3 diameter.py
```

Update `config.py` and verify your DB credentials before execution.

---

##  Best Practices

- Use a Python virtual environment for dependency management.
- Never hardcode sensitive DB credentials in production.
- Start with small PCAP samples to test your setup.
- Monitor DB performance if working with large volumes.
